              After their 12-week journey to becoming Full-Stack Developers, our
              students have grown their technical skills. These students have
              gone from little to no experience to learning HTML/CSS,
              JavaScript, React and then diving into a back-end technology stack
              to round out their full-stack understanding.
            </p>
