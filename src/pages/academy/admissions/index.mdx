### Application Process

Admissions to the Suncoast Developers Guild’s Web Development program is done through our website. To apply, prospective students will complete and submit the application online. Questions answered in the application will assist faculty and staff in considering candidates.

Technology-oriented interests and career goals, motivation, problem solving skills, and creativity will be primary indicators when evaluating an applicant’s potential. Previous work and educational experience will also be considered. Students must be at least 18 years of age and hold a high school diploma or equivalent.

Applicants will be invited to a series of interviews with a combination of: the Program Director, instructors, and alumni of the program. If a consensus is found that the applicant is a good fit for the program, the student will be notified of acceptance. A signed Student Enrollment Agreement is also required. The Student Enrollment Agreement will not be signed by the school prior to the student signing the document.

### Diversity Scholarship

Suncoast Developers Guild seeks to narrow the gaps in our industry by introducing local companies to diverse talent. We offer a scholarship to members of communities that are underrepresented in technology.

- This opportunity is available, but not limited to: self-identifying women, people of color, individuals with disabilities, and the LGBTQ community. Members of all underrepresented groups may apply for this scholarship.
- We will deduct the scholarship amount from the total cost of tuition.
