          I knew it would be hard, especially with three young children to care
          for. I also knew it would be worth it in the end. The Iron Yard
          experience turned out to be just as hard as I ever imagined, but also
          just as worth it. I accomplished what I set out to do. And really,
          there are few things better in life than that. Achieving a goal you've
          worked hard for."

          has made on our business, as well as my life. We built Shoot To Thrill
          Media, and I made the conscious decision to dive deep and learn to
          code soon after. This skillset has empowered me to provide for my
          family, impact my community, and grow my business in a way that would
          have not been possible without you. Thank you for empowering me to
