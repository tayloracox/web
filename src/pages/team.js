      <h2>Our Team</h2>

      <h3>Jason L Perry, Chief Executive Officer</h3>
      <p>
        Jason is a native Floridian who started building for the web as a teen
        in the mid-’90s, so he’s been a web developer for about as long as
        anybody. Co-founding the Tampa Ruby Brigade in 2006, Suncoast Developers
        Guild in 2015, Jason takes pride in being a leader in the local tech
        community. After stints in academia, startups, and as a consulting
        freelancer, he’s found great joy in mentoring and sharing the knowledge
        gained along the way. He’s also a game development enthusiast,
        passionate about cryptocurrency, and loves animation. Jason is a father,
        a skeptic, entirely too opinionated, and prefers a word count in powers
        of two. When the world gets heavy you can find him either unbuilding
        LEGO® sets as catharsis or harnessing his power animal—the panda.

      <h3>Toni Warren, President</h3>
      <p>
        Toni was born in South Carolina, raised in Virginia, and lives in
        Florida, where she learned to love the southeast, sunny weather, and
        Chihuahuas. After receiving her MBA at the University of Tampa, she
        began to share the impact of how technology can help nonprofit
        organizations touch more people. As former Campus Director of The Iron
        Yard, she understands the needs for talented developers. Her passion is
        people and believes technology can help people achieve better results,
        quicker. She is excited about the warm welcome from St. Petersburg/Tampa
        and looks forward to collaborating with the community to develop amazing
        developers who want to make awesome things.

      <h3>Holly Valenty, Program Director</h3>
      <p>
        Holly is born and raised in St. Petersburg, Florida. She is a graduate
        of the University of Florida, where she studied Family, Youth, and
        Community Science and became an avid Gator football fan. After
        completing her degree, Holly worked within Marketing and the Tech
        industry. She found what she loved most was connecting people to their
        passions, and exploring new ways to improve the world around us. Holly
        is passionate about helping students change their lives through a new
        career. When not working with students, Holly can be found cuddling her
        dog, Lola, learning to code, or exploring new restaurants.

      <h3>Gavin Stark, Chief Technology Officer</h3>
      <p>
        Gavin is a native of Florida and currently resides in St. Petersburg.
        Fearful he would someday melt under the Florida sun, Gavin took a break
        from the Sunshine State and studied mathematics and computer science in
        Rochester, New York and Management Information Systems in Tucson,
        Arizona. Gavin has been writing software since programs were saved on
        tape and source code was printed in magazines. When not programming, he
        can be found wondering if he will ever finish book four of the ‘A Song
        of Fire and Ice’ series, promoting a future of electric cars, convincing
        his girlfriend that PopTarts™‚ should go in the shopping cart since they
        are healthy because they contain seven minerals, and recently trying his
        hand at improv comedy.

      <h3>Mark Dewey, Core Instructor</h3>
      <p>
        Mark has seen success in both the government and commercial arenas of
        software engineering. Graduating from University of Pitt at Johnstown
        with a BS in Computer Science, Mark has fostered a love of being a
        lifelong learner. Through his journey of building a wide variety of
        software, Mark has found a passion for revolutionizing industries and a
        drive to improve people’s lives through new technology and paradigms.
        When not trying to change the world, Mark can be found outside enjoying
        the sun in his hammock, learning a new hobby or redesigning a bad user
        experience. Over the years, Mark has developed a passion for mentoring
        young and ambitious talent, and wants to bring developer training to the
        next level.
