## Setup

The project is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) based site. We also use [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) for some content management.

After cloning the project, run `npm install` to install dependencies, and `npm start` to launch the development server on http://localhost:8000/.

## Issues

Please, feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests.

## Contributing

In general, we follow this workflow:

1.  **Fork** the repo on GitHub.
2.  **Clone** the project to your own machine.
3.  **Commit** changes to your own branch.
4.  **Push** your work back up to your fork.
5.  Submit a **Pull Request** so that we can review your changes.

**NOTE**: Be sure to merge the latest from _upstream_ before making a Pull Request.

Before committing be sure to run `npm run lint` against your project and fix any formatting issues. Pull Requests won't be merged without clean linter output.
