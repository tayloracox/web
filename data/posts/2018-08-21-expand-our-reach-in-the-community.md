Over the last year, Suncoast Developers Guild has continued to strive towards a sustainable model of providing coding education for the Tampa Bay area. As the only not-for-profit coding school in the state of Florida, we aim to provide our students with the digital tools they need for success. Whether it’s to improve their own business or further their personal goals, we believe that the development of technical skills is vital in nurturing an innovative community. 



Our story originates with The Iron Yard, the largest national coding school that provided hundreds with the tools they needed to meet their personal goals in the tech sphere. When it ended operations at all locations last year, we saw it as an opportunity to refine the vision that began with The Iron Yard and shift our focus to exclusively providing the Tampa Bay area with a quality education. We decided to expand our curriculum and share our collective coding knowledge following a model that focuses on what’s important: educating the community. 



We believe our community-centric mission aligns directly with Facebook Community Boost’s goal of providing US workers and entrepreneurs with the “digital skills they need to compete in today’s economy.” The message behind the #BoostTogether movement directly encompasses Suncoast Developers Guild’s mission. While we have refined our process since The Iron Yard days, there is still more work to be done in discovering how we can best expand to potential students in the local area. With the help of Facebook Community Boost, we can:



Expand our reach in the community

Build Suncoast Developers Guild to meet the Tampa Bay area’s growing tech needs

Continue to grow our program to prepare our students for an evolving tech scene 



Running four cohorts each year, our three-month program at the Academy provides a comprehensive curriculum designed to prepare students for the workforce. Encompassing both front- and back-end development, students will graduate with the knowledge needed to build and maintain web sites and applications. By giving our students the tools they need to achieve their goals, their current and future projects will foster an environment teaming with opportunities for the community.



Since our beginning, we have had several of our students achieve success with our program. Alumni Mark Lombardi-Nelson has applied his coding skills to innovate his business and provide improved services for the community:

 I can't begin to express the gratitude and impact learning to code has made on our business, as well as my life. We built Shoot To Thrill Media, and I made the conscious decision to dive deep and learn to code soon after. This skillset has empowered me to provide for my family, impact my community, and grow my business in a way that would have not been possible without you. Thank you for empowering me to have the confidence and ability to follow my dreams. – Mark Lombardi-Nelson



Mark is one of many success stories of alumni using their coding knowledge to enhance their personal and professional lives. Suncoast Developers Guild serves as a hub for the local tech scene, providing a network of alumni, employers, and organizations. We present students with the opportunity to meet others in the field and build connections.



With the help of Facebook Community Boost, we can collectively further our goals of creating a workforce prepared with the digital tools they need to thrive. New students enter our doors with each cohort, eager to learn and improve their lives through coding. By bringing Facebook Community Boost’s resources to the local level, we can further support our growing student base in the Tampa Bay tech scene.
