  With the rising demand of web developers, it is hard for companies to find and
  quickly recruit talented individuals for their development teams. SDG not only
  helps provide tech education to individuals but we also offer joint training
  and workforce initiatives to assist companies, such as Proforma, in
  onboarding, recruiting, and improving their team.

The demand for developers is rising every single day and will continue to do so for at least the next decade. The proof is in the things that play a major role in your everyday life: ordering and taking a ride with Lyft, shopping online, or telling Amazon Alexa to play your favorite song. As the world is becoming more and more reliant on technology, naturally, the demand for developers to build these things increases as well. The proof can also be seen within [statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm) which project software developer jobs to grow at 24% which is well beyond the 7% average growth rate for all occupations. This is great for current coders, but it introduces a gap. With the skyrocketing demand, it’s difficult for the current workforce to provide the technical skills and ability to be able to keep up. Additionally, this places huge constraints on companies’ ability to grow. A specific example of this can be seen with our Advisory Board member, [Proforma](www.proforma.com). They were looking to quickly expand their team with highly skilled individuals. For this reason, Proforma and SDG worked together to provide training outside of our standard tuition-based program to help build up their development team. Since then, two other students have gone through the tuition-based program through opportunities with Proforma.

Our mission is to provide web development education to individuals looking to skill-up or change careers, and teaming up with companies has proven to be a way to not only help build up the tech [community](https://suncoast.io/blog/for-the-community-and-by-the-community/), but also strengthen companies from within. This is an opportunity for local companies and the local community whether companies are looking to put a few current employees through cohorts, sponsor fresh talent and put them through a cohort, or run full cohorts customized towards the tech stack that they use. SDG’s [joint training](https://suncoast.io/community/joint-training) and workforce initiatives assist companies in identifying, training, onboarding, and improving their software development team. We are focused on being a program that meets the needs of our community and excited to have companies such as Proforma that we can help make that focus a reality. Explore their experience with us by reading their full testimonial:

## The Academy at Suncoast Developers Guild Testimonial from Proforma

As the Tampa Bay technology community continues to expand and become a center for innovation and software development, the current workforce is not keeping pace with the required technical skills and the available resources are inadequate to support the demand.  When Proforma looked to rapidly expand our technology team, we decided to partner with Suncoast Developers Guild to create an integrated approach to talent acquisition and skills development essential for entry-level employment.  

The result was an innovative workforce preparedness program that provided Proforma with an influx of well-trained talent and provided motivated candidates with a valuable educational program that guaranteed full time employment upon successful course completion.  

The Proforma/SDG partnership selected passionate junior level candidates and created an intensive training curriculum.  This customized curriculum would fine tune technology concepts and focus on the skill sets necessary to be successful at Proforma.  

SDG’s core curriculum of modern web development as well as full-stack applications was a perfect fit for Proforma. SDG’s approach to education is grounded in a solid base of research and best practices.  Their performance-based learning curriculum guides students through an intense 12 week process that demands the mastery of concepts in a fast paced environment.  The curriculum culminates with a final capstone project that will actually be implemented in Proforma’s technology. 

Central to the success of this program was the true partnership that developed between Proforma and SDG. Frequent interaction between the Proforma technology team, the SDG instructors and the candidates created an exceptional learning environment.  The partnership allowed for incoming candidates to receive detailed exposure to Proforma’s technology stack and receive real world experience that is hard to create in a classroom environment.  

This program was extremely successful for SDG, Proforma, the candidates and the Tampa Bay technology community at large. Proforma would highly recommend the SDG program to anyone looking to further their career in the technology field.  We also look forward to partnering with SDG on many more projects in the future.
