When we started Suncoast Developers Guild we decided to operate as a 501(c)3

non-profit. We will likely have a blog post covering this, but we felt this

freed us from interests that were more concerned with profitability than doing

what is best for our students. This also allows us to operating in the open.

While we were discussing this openness we decided that our curriculum would also

be open.



As an institution that charges a tuition for our programs you might be asking

"If you make the curriculum open, why would people pay you for your classes?"

That is a great question! When interviewing students for several years a common

story we have heard is that many students have used both free and paid learning

resources online but felt they were blocked from learning by the lack of a

mentor/guide/teacher. We acknowledge in the interview process than many

students can, and will, learn on their own and online. In fact some of our

instructors and volunteers are self taught. So while the presence of

free, low cost, or even open source learning resources online are fantastic, we

feel that our "secret sauce" is the skill, commitment, and passion of our

instructors and staff.



Our instructors come from long histories of working as professional software

developers. Our instructors mostly work with open source languages and

technologies, even contributing to those projects.



We also run our classes utilizing open source software including Atom, VS Code,

git, node, Ruby, Rails, bash/zsh, and .Net Core. These are the tools and

languages our students will be learning. Without these projects our task would

be much more difficult.



Our team comes from previously operating The Iron Yard Tampa Bay and during

that time we supported the internal product team developing instructional tools

and supporting curriculum writing. We noticed that the curriculum writing was

an enormous project which was difficult to write, complex to review, and was

done in isolation from other instructors, our students, and the tech community

we serve. When released, like any product, there were bugs which required

revision. We also know that since desire to teach the most up-to-date

techniques and technologies our community is using, we must consistently update

this curriculum.



Open source software typically builds upon the efforts of others and extends

it. This is our goal for our curriculum. As we continue to develop our

curriculum we will be inviting our alumni, local community, and community at

large to contribute. We are excited to share our lessons, assignments, and

approach with the community and look forward to your contributions.
