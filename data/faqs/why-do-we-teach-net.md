Apart from being a strong, versatile, and extremely popular language, .NET is a somewhat unusual choice for a boot camp to teach. Its a vast language that can go from sweet and simple to deep and complex very quickly. We have chosen for a few key reasons. Not only is a strong market need for .NET developers, but the syntax and basic concepts of the language offers a strong springboard to learn other languages.



In teaching .NET, this not only gives students a solid resume upon leaving, but it gives them a solid point a references when they learn they next couple of languages. Also, .NET is currently experiencing a renaissance with .NET Core, helping our students gain valuable experience in a rapidly growing culture and learn a bleeding edge technology that also applies to more classic web apps.
