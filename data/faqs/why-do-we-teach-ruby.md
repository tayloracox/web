Ruby is powerful programing language that has a very loyal and vast ecosystem. Ruby was designed with a few key ideas in mind; an easy to use object oriented focused scripting language that maximizes developer happiness. These core principles lead to Ruby being a popular language to quickly create powerful and useful applications. 

Using Ruby, this allows students to potentially not worry about the complexity that may come with other languages, and focus on learning concepts and building ideas. Not only does this provide a solid learning experience for the student, but at SDG and in the Tampa Bay Area, we have industry partners requesting that we continue teaching this much needed language to continue to support the local Ruby jobs market.
